# ðŸ¦„ Uniswap V3 Calculator & Simulator

> Quick Note: This project was originally created around August 2021 soon after the launch of Uniswap V3. It was a fun project to work on and I learned a lot about Uniswap V3 in the process. This repo here is the OSS version of the tool, ported as-is. Which means, some of the patterns here aren't quite the best. I've tried my best to bring it up to date with my standard Next template and preferred practices, but it's nowhere near perfect. The goal was to split the tool from the Metacrypt monorepo in order to make it more accessible. Very much open to improvements and PRs. Enjoy!
